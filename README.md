# Exploratory-Analysis-of-Global-Warming-Statistics
The study examined the effects of various global warming statistics on child mortality. The purpose of the
study was to identify potential factors impacting on child mortality rates and examine the degree to which
the factors did so. Through studying these factors, the report intends to outline areas in which improvement
will provide the greatest reduction in child mortality. The World Bank Climate Change data was visually
inspected and cleaned before potential predictor variables were identified. Multiple linear regression was
consequently performed using these predictor variables. Lasso Regression and Random Forest modelling
were then used to examine the magnitude of impact that each predictor variable has on the response. From
the study, we see that Electricity Access, Primary School Completion Rate, CO2 Emissions and Population
were identified as having a statistically significant relationship with Under-5 Mortality. Furthermore, from
the variety of models utilised it was consistently displayed that Electricity Access and Primary School
Completion Rate have the greatest importance in predicting child mortality. From these findings, the study
was able to recommend further analysis into the identified variables, with consultation from financial experts
in order analysis which variables will see the greatest improvement relative to cost. These recommendations
are made to ensure the best allocation of funds and resources which will in turn result in the greatest
reduction of Child Mortality.
